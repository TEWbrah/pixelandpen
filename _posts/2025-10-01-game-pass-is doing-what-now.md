So I have no idea what Microsoft is doing, but they’ve increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $29.99. They say it’s because they’ve added Fortnite Crew ($11.99 by itself) and Ubisoft Plus Classics ($7.99 by itself), so technically you save money by going with the deal. But if you never play Fortnite and have no interest in, or have already played, all the Ubisoft games (I own them all), then you’re paying for useless benefits.

It was already the most expensive monthly gaming subscription, and now it’s been increased to include niche features. On top of that news, the website to cancel subscriptions overloaded and crashed. I guess GameStop and GameFly are about to have a comeback. We may even see a return of physical media as a whole.

I’ll stick to PC with Steam, but I will now for sure buy the games I was only mildly interested in on there—or get them from GameFly when I have enough to rent. I don’t see how this is a smart business move, as it is clearly costing them money, and the site crash is the clearest example. Crazy what companies think we’ll put up with until they finally push too far.

I hope Sony sees this as a warning not to overcharge for their product. Premium is sitting at $159.99 a year, or $13.33 a month. That’s a good price for what they offer with Premium, especially considering the cost of many of the PS2 and PS3 games included in the plan.

More and more changes are happening in the gaming industry, and it’s crazy to watch in real time.
