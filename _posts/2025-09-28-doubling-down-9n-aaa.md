"Game developing is so complicated now." And I get that. I understand that large-scale games are complicated, and that most indie games are nowhere near as complex as an open-world game, so of course they are prone to more issues and need more fixes.

But wait—Elden Ring was damn near perfect. Loved by all, and it won Game of the Year for its excellence. Did it have some issues? Sure. But not to the same extent as most AAA games over the last ten years. And yet the complexity of that game was immense: branching stories, several endings, many different paths, complete freedom—and in all that, they created one of the greatest games ever.

If they can do it, why can’t other AAA studios? It seems to me that the way FromSoftware approaches development is far different from most studios. I’ve also noticed that Japanese game developers as a whole release nearly polished games compared to most European and Western developers. The only ones that come close are indie studios, and that’s usually only because of how simple their games are.

Maybe Hidetaka Miyazaki needs to offer a master class in game development—because they sure nailed it.
